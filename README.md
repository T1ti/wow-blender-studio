# wow-blender-studio

This is a copy of an old version of the WoW Blender Studio addon that has been updated to work with newer versions of Blender, such as 3.0.0 Alpha (per 2021-06-02).

Credit for developing this addon goes to Skarn.

`Note:` this project uses *git LFS*. Some files won't be downloaded when cloning unless you enable it. It can be done by entering project directory (via command line) and typing `git lfs install`.
